/*
Q5: A parking lot business charges a minimum of 2â‚º for parks made up to 3 hours. If 3 hours are
exceeded, 0.5 TL is charged for each hour. The maximum amount taken is 10 TL in case of parking for
24 hours. Assume that no vehicle is parked for more than 24 hours. Write a program that calculates
the payments of 3 customers who parked in this parking lot yesterday in a function and prints them
in the main program. (The user must enter the parking time of each customer and the output should
be in neat tabular form and program should calculate their total revenue). The program has to
calculate the fee for each customer in a function called calculatepayment.(1st customer is 1.5 hours,
2nd customer is 4 hours, 3rd customer is 24 hours left)
*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

float calculatepayment(int t)
{
float price;
if(t&lt;=3)
price=2;
else if(t&gt;16)
price=10;
else
price= 2+(t-3)*0.5;
return price;
}

int main()
{
float hour;
for(int i=1;i&lt;=3;i++)
{
printf(&quot;Enter your %d. car parking time:&quot;, i);
scanf(&quot;%f&quot;,&amp;hour);

printf(&quot;Your costumer has to pay %.1f liras \n&quot;, calculatepayment(hour));
}
}
