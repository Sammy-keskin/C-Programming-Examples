/*
Q4: Write a program that finds whether a number entered by the user is prime in the 1st function, prints
it in the main program if it is prime, and if the number is not prime, finds the sum of its factors in the
2nd function and prints it in the main program. (The program will terminate when the number zero is
entered.)
